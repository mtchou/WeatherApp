# A Weather React App  

This is a web app to display weather based on the city you typed in. I mainly follow a tutorial, but made some changes (tutorial: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GuA0_Z1llYU&ab_channel=TylerPotts).

The main goal is to practice:
1. use React hook (useState) 
2. retrieve data from an external API (OpenWeatherAPI).

The main differences I made from the tutorial are:
1. Separate codes into three components - SearchBox, LocationBox, and WeatherBox
2. Add a code formatter (prettier). You can use "yarn run app:fix-format" to fix the coding format.
3. Use a date library to display the date ("https://date-fns.org/")
