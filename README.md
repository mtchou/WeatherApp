# A Weather React App

This is a practice project based on https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GuA0_Z1llYU&ab_channel=TylerPotts. The main project is to use React hook (useState) and retrieve data from an external API (OpenWeatherAPI).

but I made some changes:
1. Separate codes into different components
2. Add a code formatter (prettier). You can use "yarn run app:fix-format" to fix the coding format.
3. Use a date library to display the date ("https://date-fns.org/")
